# Code-Quiz

Hi! This is my attempt at making a code-quiz through javascript.

These are the steps that I went through to create it:

1) Established my index.html
    -created sections to display my questions and timer.
2) Created and linked my javascript file. 
    -Chose variables to store and display game content.
    -Created a timer.
